;; RECV -- selective retrieval of messages
;;
;; Any messages not matching one of the RECV clauses gets stashed in a
;; FIFO queue for later replay after the RECV clause either succeeds
;; or times out.
;;
;; Even though each RECV clause is entirely asynchronous, a series of
;; successive RECV clauses will apply successively. So syntax will
;; match semantics in this case. (Not generally true of asynchronous
;; clauses)

(defmacro recv (&rest clauses)
  ;;
  ;; a RECV uses Optima:MATCH style patterns and clauses.
  ;;
  ;; RECV receives and processes one qualifying message, or gets timed
  ;; out. Messages arriving at the Actor's mailbox which do not
  ;; qualify for any of the RECV clauses will be stashed during the
  ;; waiting period. RECV operates asynchronously and does not block
  ;; waiting.
  ;;
  ;; After RECV either times out or receives a qualifying message, the
  ;; body forms of the Actor that follow the RECV form will be in
  ;; effect, the stashed messages will be replayed, and the Actor will
  ;; be using its original behavior on those and all future messages.
  ;;
  ;; If there is a :TIMEOUT expression inside the RECV form, the Actor
  ;; will setup a timeout timer on that expression. If a qualifying
  ;; message does not arrive before the timer expires, a timeout will
  ;; occur. That timeout will execute the form listed after
  ;; :ON-TIMEOUT if given, or else a timeout error will be generated.
  ;;
  ;; In the macro, we parse the handler body to create a function
  ;; which takes a message and returns a fully deconstructed pattern
  ;; match closure, or nil. This allows us to cancel any pending
  ;; timeout if a message qualifies.
  ;;
  ;; An Actor containing a RECV form will not execute that form until
  ;; it receives some message that causes it to execute a branch of
  ;; code contained in the RECV form.
